# Week16JeepSalesFinal

This is the final week of the Jeep Sales project. We added HTTP POST in this week, which now makes for the use of GET and POST HTTP verbs in this project. The verbs PUT and DELETE are not part of this project. The GET verb gets a Jeep and POST creates an order for a Jeep. This project demonstrates the functionality of Web API, the interactions between the main method, controller, service, and DAO layers, as well as test driven development.
